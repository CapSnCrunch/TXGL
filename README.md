This is the code repository for UT Austin's TXGL Project 2 (https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/geometry_lab/project-2)

In this project, we study the actions of SL2(R) matrix groups on RP1. Given a finitely presented group G, we want to algorithmically determine whether the homomorphism from G into one of these matric groups is faithful.

## Faithful Actions
